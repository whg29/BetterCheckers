Better Checkers

Server-Side Documentation
For "server.js" and "checkerBoard.js"

==Running the Server==
Start up server.js using Node. This will run checkerBoard.js.

==Submitting Moves==
All the client needs to do is submit a move. The server will do all the calculations of whether or not the move is valid. The client does not need to do any input validation or move checking.
To submit a move to the server, use the "redMove" or "blackMove" endpoints with two arguments: source square ("space": "a1", "c5", etc.), and direction ("direction": "NW", "NE", "SW", "SE").
Example: 
"/blackMove?space=a3&direction=NE"

The response will be a JSON object containing the following items:
	"board": 2-dimensional array of integers representing the board.
		0: Empty
		1: Red man
		2: Black man
		3: Red king
		4: Black king
	"message": String intended to be displayed to the player.
	"status": Integer indicating the state of the game.
		0: Game is still in progress
		>=1: Game is over - in this case, the "message" will be a message of which player has won the game and why.

If a valid move is made, the game will switch to the other player's turn. If a player tries to input a move while it is not their turn, the game will return the JSON response with the message indicating to the player that it is the other player's turn.

==Updating==
The "update" endpoint will return a JSON object containing the following items: 
	"board": Same as before.
	"message": String intended to be displayed to the player. It indicates the status of the game - will be blank if the game is not over, or will be a message if the game is over that explains why the game is over.
	"turn": Integer indicator of whose turn it is (0 for black or 1 for red). 
The idea behind this endpoint is that the client should call this endpoint every second or so.

==Test Suite==
You can run some server-side tests by using Node to run testSuite.js. This file contains several sets of test cases divided into sections which you can uncomment to choose which one(s) to run.
