Server-Side Documentation

==Submitting Moves==
To submit a move to the server, use the endpoints "redMove" or "blackMove" with two arguments, source square ("space": "a1", "c5", etc.) and direction ("direction": "NW", "NE", "SW", "SE").
Example: 
"/blackMove?space=a3&direction=NE"

The response will be a JSON object containing the following items:
	"board": 2-dimensional array of integers representing the board.
		0: empty
		1: red man
		2: black man
		3: red king
		4: black king
	"status": Integer indicating the state of the game.
		0: game still in progress
		1: game is over
	"message": String intended to be displayed to the player.

If a valid move is made, the game will switch to the other player's turn. If a player tries to input a move while it is not their turn, the game will return the JSON response with the message indicating to the player that it is the other player's turn.

==Updating==
Every second or so, the client should call the "update" endpoint. This will return a JSON object containing the board state, the status of the game and an indicator of whose turn it is (0 for black and 1 for red).
