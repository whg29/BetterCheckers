Server-Side Documentation

==Running the Server==
Start up server.js using Node.

==Submitting Moves==
To submit a move to the server, use the "redMove" or "blackMove" endpoints with two arguments: source square ("space": "a1", "c5", etc.), and direction ("direction": "NW", "NE", "SW", "SE").
Example: 
"/blackMove?space=a3&direction=NE"

The response will be a JSON object containing the following items:
	"board": 2-dimensional array of integers representing the board.
		0: empty
		1: red man
		2: black man
		3: red king
		4: black king
	"status": Integer indicating the state of the game.
		0: game still in progress
		1: game is over
	"message": String intended to be displayed to the player.

If a valid move is made, the game will switch to the other player's turn. If a player tries to input a move while it is not their turn, the game will return the JSON response with the message indicating to the player that it is the other player's turn.

==Updating==
The "update" endpoint will return a JSON object containing the board state, the status of the game and an indicator of whose turn it is (0 for black and 1 for red). The idea behind this is that the client should call this endpoint every second or so.

==Test Suite==
You can run some server-side tests by using Node to run testSuite.js. This file contains several sets of test cases divided into sections which you can uncomment to choose which one(s) to run.
